# Tutorial 18 - Less is more

In the [previous tutorial][1] we injected the form validators into the
corresponding WUI (Web User Interface) in such a way that the user
will be notified with the corresponding error messages when the she/he
types in invalid values in the form. Although this series of tutorials
is mainly dedicated to CLJS, to be respectful with the progressive
enhancement strategy, we started to inject the form validators into
the server-side code first. 

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're coming back to the client-side code to
inject the form validators into the CLJS code we implemented in the
[Tutorial 10 - Introducing Ajax ][2].

## CLJS code review

Before to start coding let's review the CLJS code we implemented in
the [Tutorial 10 - Introducing Ajax][] for the Shopping Calculator.

```clj
;; src/cljs/modern_cljs/shopping.cljs fragment

(ns modern-cljs.shopping
  (:require-macros [hiccups.core :refer [html]])
  (:require [domina :refer [by-id value by-class set-value! append! destroy!]]
            [domina.events :refer [listen! prevent-default]]
            [hiccups.runtime :as hiccupsrt]
            [shoreleave.remotes.http-rpc :refer [remote-callback]]))

(defn calculate [evt]
  (let [quantity (value (by-id "quantity"))
        price (value (by-id "price"))
        tax (value (by-id "tax"))
        discount (value (by-id "discount"))]
    (remote-callback :calculate
                     [quantity price tax discount]
                     #(set-value! (by-id "total") (.toFixed % 2)))
    (prevent-default evt)))

(defn ^:export init []
  (when ...
	    ...
    (listen! (by-id "calc") :click (fn [evt] (calculate evt)))
    ...
    ...))
```

As you see, by using the [Domina][] `listen!` function, we
attached the CLJS `calculate` function to the `:click` event of the
`Calculate` submit button (in fact we wrapped the `calculate` function
inside an anonymous function and passed it the triggered event).

The CLJS `calculate` function, again through [Domina][] lib, first
gets the stringified values typed in by the user in the form input
fields, then set the value of the `total` input field by stringifing
the result of asynchroning calling (i.e. via ajax) the remote CLJ
`calculate` function.

As we already saw in the [previous tutorial][1] [Tutorial 15][10] the
user can easly break the Shopping Calculator the which fails if it
receives invalid arguments as we sae


rebuild and run the modern-cljs project
to review its behaviour.

Let's review the CLJS Shopping Calculatcode we already implemented for the Shopping Calculator.


attached 
`click` event of the Calculate submit button an anonymous function
which just wraps the `calculate` function by passing it the event
itself.


The most direct path to reach our objective of integrating the form
validators in the client-side code seems to is apparantly to refactor
the original CLJS code based on the [Domina][3] library to make room
for the validators themselves.
